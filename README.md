As a Software Analyst, I want to:
 
1 -  Access any given Web Site and save the URL to a NoSQL database of your preference
2 -  Collect all available links within this initial Web Site and also save it to the database
3 -  For each record found in step 2, collect all available links within this URL and repeat this process until no more links are found.
 
- Finally, your application must have a Front-End where users can interact with.
 
Please, as an extra effort, include in your solution the following:
- Your code should be on your GitHub profile;
- Your code should have unit tests;
- Your code should be hosted on IBM Cloud;
- Your code should run inside one or more docker containers, bonus points if running inside an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Cluster.
